# Manage packages in dotnet projects

The official package manager in `.Net` project is called **NuGet**. 

## 1. Install NuGet CLI.

The NuGet CLI is released as a single file executable called `nuget.exe`. You can go to the [official page](https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
to download it.

After download, you can place it in a folder (e.g., C:\Tools\nuget\).

You need to add that folder to your `system PATH` to use nuget from anywhere.

## 2. Verify Installation

In a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
```shell
nuget
```
You should see some outputs if the installation is succeeded.

## 3. Use nuget to manage package

All available packages can be found in the [NuGet gallery](https://www.nuget.org/PACKAGES).

```shell
cd /path/to/YourProject

# restore all packages already defined in .csproj
nuget restore YourProject.csproj

# add new package into a project
nuget install Tomlyn
```

> Tomlyn is a package to read, write, and validate a toml config file. You can find more details [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tomlyn)

## NuGet integration in Dotnet sdk 

Since `.Net 5+` sdk, the `NuGet` is fully integrated into the sdk. So we can use the `dotnet CLI` to manage packages

```shell
dotnet add package Tomlyn --version 0.19.0
```

You will notice there is a new line in `<ItemGroup>` of your `.csproj` file.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Tomlyn"  Version="0.19.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Behind the scenes, this command will start the below actions:
- Contact NuGet using the default NuGet feed, download the NuGet package from `nuget.org` into `your user-level NuGet cache (not into the project folder)`.
- Add a <PackageReference> line into your .csproj file
- Make the package immediately available for your project

## Real world example

You can check the [ReadToml](../tutorials/02.ReadToml) dotnet project to see how to add packages.
